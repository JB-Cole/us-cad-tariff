### Welcome to an interactive dashboard for exploring the impact of U.S. - Canada tariffs on Canada's production and construction sectors.

### Background
The Canadian Construction and Production industry is facing significant challenges due to recent trade tensions and retaliatory tariffs between Canada and the United States. 
In response to the U.S. tariffs on aluminum and steel, Canada has introduced tariffs on an additional $29.8 billion worth of U.S. products (on top of the pre-existing $30 billion worth of goods). 
For more details, visit [Canada vs U.S.](https://www.cfib-fcei.ca/en/site/us-tariffs#:~:text=Canada%20has%20imposed%20a%2025,billion%20worth%20of%20U.S.%20goods.&text=In%20response%20to%20the%20U.S.,%2430%20billion%20worth%20of%20goods)

### Data Source
This app utilizes web scraping to retrieve the following data from Statistics Canada:
- **Raw Materials Price Indices (RMPI)** for Metal ores, concentrates and scrap [M61]
- **Industrial Product Price Index (IPPI)** for Fabricated metal products and construction materials [P63]

### Visualization
Visualize trends using line plots that highlight two key phases of the tariff dispute:
- The tariff implementation (January 2025)
- The subsequent lobbying period (March 2025)

The retrieved data is stored in CSV files, available for download on the **Data** page.

### Navigation
Use the sidebar to switch between pages:
- **Data**
- **Trends (IPPI vs RMPI)**
